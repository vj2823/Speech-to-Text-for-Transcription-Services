# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project focuses on building a **Speech-to-Text (STT)** system designed to assist **transcription services**. It leverages machine learning and audio processing techniques to automatically convert spoken language into written text.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- Load and preprocess audio data.
- Perform feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs) from audio signals.
- Train machine learning models for speech recognition.
- Evaluate model performance and make predictions on new audio inputs.

The project is implemented as a **Jupyter Notebook** for better visualization, modular development, and experimentation.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-transcription.git
   cd speech-to-text-transcription
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

The main libraries used include:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `librosa`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch`

> *(You can generate a `requirements.txt` easily from the notebook if needed.)*

## Usage

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in order:
   - Load and visualize audio data.
   - Extract features (e.g., MFCCs).
   - Train the speech-to-text model.
   - Evaluate and test predictions.

3. Optionally, modify the notebook to use your own audio samples for testing.

## Model Details

The notebook includes:
- **Audio Preprocessing:** Trimming, noise reduction, and normalization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
- **Modeling Approaches:** Traditional ML (SVM, Random Forest) or Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Word Error Rate (WER), and sample transcriptions.

## Results

The trained model achieves **[insert your model's accuracy/WER here]** on the test set.

Sample transcription outputs demonstrate the model's ability to generalize across varied audio inputs.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate larger datasets with diverse accents and noise levels.
- Implement end-to-end deep learning models (e.g., Wav2Vec2.0).
- Deploy the model via a real-time API for live transcription services.
- Integrate grammar correction post-processing.
